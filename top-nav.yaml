# The syntax for this file specifying our top navigation dropdowns is similar to
# the one used in siteConfig.yaml, but because it's not a native Redocly
# component, it doesn't have access to all the data the native "nav" has. One
# major limitation is you can't use page: some/file.md as an entry.
