                is a technology company that makes it easier to build a
                high-performance, global payments business. XRP is a digital

              <p>
                There is a finite amount of XRP. All XRP is already in existence
                today—no more than the original 100 billion can be created. The
                XRPL founders gifted 80 billion XRP, the platform’s native
                currency, to Ripple. To provide predictability to the XRP
                supply, Ripple has locked 55 billion XRP (55% of the total
                possible supply) into a series of escrows using the XRP Ledger
                itself. The XRPL's transaction processing rules, enforced by the
                consensus protocol, control the release of the XRP.
