# Consensus Protocol Properties

The XRP Ledger uses a consensus protocol unlike any digital asset that came before it. This protocol, known as the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, is designed to have the following important properties:

- Everyone who uses the XRP Ledger can agree on the latest state, and which transactions have occurred in which order.
- All valid transactions are processed without needing a central operator or having a single point of failure.
- The ledger can make progress even if some participants join, leave, or behave inappropriately.
- If too many participants are unreachable or misbehaving, the network fails to make progress rather than diverging or confirming invalid transactions.
- Confirming transactions does not require wasteful or competitive use of resources, unlike most other blockchain systems.

These properties are sometimes summarized as the following principles, in order of priority: **Correctness, Agreement, Forward Progress**.

This protocol is still evolving, as is our knowledge of its limits and possible failure cases.
