# Payment Types
  The XRP Ledger supports point-to-point XRP payments alongside other, more specialized payment types.

- [Direct XRP Payments](direct-xrp-payments.md)

  Direct XRP payments are the simplest way to send value in the XRP Ledger.

- [Cross-Currency Payments](cross-currency-payments.md)

  Cross-currency payments atomically deliver a different currency than they send by converting through paths and order books.

- [Checks](checks.md)

  Checks let users create deferred payments that can be canceled or cashed by the intended recipients.

- [Escrow](escrow.md)

  Escrows set aside XRP and deliver it later when certain conditions are met. Escrows can depend on time limits, cryptographic conditions, or both.

- [Partial Payments](partial-payments.md)

  Partial payments subtract fees from the amount sent, delivering a flexible amount. Partial payments are useful for returning unwanted payments without incurring additional costs.

- [Payment Channels](payment-channels.md)

  Payment Channels enable fast, asynchronous XRP payments that can be divided into very small increments and settled later.
