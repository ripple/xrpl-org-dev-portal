# Tokenization

These use cases focus on capabilities on the XRP Ledger for working with tokens rather than native XRP.

<XRPLCardDeck cols="1/3">
  <DeckCard title="Stablecoin Issuer" to="stablecoin-issuer.md">
    As a Stablecoin Issuer, I want to use the XRPL to issue my own stablecoin, taking
    advantage of the lower cost per transaction and decade-long stability of the XRPL.
  </DeckCard>
  <DeckCard title="Token Marketplace" to="nftoken-marketplace.md">
    In my NFToken Marketplace, I want to use the XRPL to create a marketplace site where I
    can arrange transfer of a curated selection of NFTokens to consumers, with the benefit
    that I can build a brand and earn broker fees based on sales.
  </DeckCard>
  <DeckCard title="Authorized Minter" to="authorized-minter.md">
    Convert tokens from one currency to another on the decentralized exchange.
  </DeckCard>
  <DeckCard title="Digital Artist" to="digital-artist.md">
    As a Digital Artist, I want to use the XRPL to create a NFToken of my work and sell it
    on the XRPL, because the XRPL is both cost efficient and carbon neutral.
