The XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange consists of an unlimited number of currency pairs, tracked on-demand when users make trades. A currency pair can consist of XRP and a token or two different tokens; tokens are always identified by the combination of an issuer and a currency code. Therefore, it is possible to trade between two tokens with the same currency code and different issuers, or the same issuer and different currency codes.
